**Intrusion Detection Using Machine Learning**  
**End-Semester Assessment Project** 

**Subject Code:** U18IST60002 - Cryptography and Network Security  

Intrusion Detection(IDS) monitors a network or systems for malicious activity and protects a computer network from unauthorized access from users, including perhaps insider.The motive of this project is to propose a predictive model (i.e. a classifier) capable of distinguishing between 'bad connections' (intrusions/attacks) and a 'good(normal) connections' after applying some feature extraction.
